-> Multithreading is sort of async programming.
-> How we can achieve Multiple, tasks executing at a time.
-> Parallel programming is achieved in this.
-> If something is done in a particular order its called Synchronous programming and if it is not
then its called Asynchronous programming.

ğŸ”¹ What is a Thread?
    A thread is a lightweight subprocess â€” the smallest unit of processing. It shares memory with other
    threads of the same process, making it efficient for tasks that need to run in parallel.

ğŸ”¹ Thread Lifecycle
    1)New â€“ When a thread is created
    2)Runnable â€“ After start() is called
    3)Running â€“ When thread starts executing
    4)Blocked/Waiting â€“ When thread is waiting to acquire a resource or waiting for another thread
    5)Terminated â€“ When the run() method finishes or the thread is stopped
    6)Dead â€“ When the thread is no longer referenced and is eligible for garbage collection

-> Main thread always runs first then user defined will run.
