Frameworks in Java -->
    Frameworks are blueprints or already build in features which are predefined and which we import in 
    our file.
        It has three build in *Interfaces*
            ↠ List - ArrayList(Dynamic array doesn't have fixed size), LinkedLists
                ⫸ CRUD(Create read update delete) operations can be performed.
            ↠ Sets - HashSet, LinkedSet, TreeSet
                ⫸ HashSet bans the repetition of an element, Repetitive element won't be added to the set
                    by default unsorted. 
                ⫸ TreeSet keeps the unique data and also sorts it.
